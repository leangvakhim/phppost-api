🔗 Live API Documentation: https://api.aimostore.shop/php/phppost/swagger/

📂 Tech Stack: Raw PHP, SwaggerUI, MySQL, Apache, Git, JWT Authentication


📌 Description:


A fully functional backend RESTful API service built using Raw PHP (without any framework). The project supports CRUD operations for both posts and users, fully documented with SwaggerUI to assist with API testing and developer onboarding.


    1. 🔐 JWT Authentication: Secure login/logout using token-based authentication with cookies.
    2. 👤 User Management: Create, read, update, soft-delete, and restore users.
    3. 📝 Post Management: Add, retrieve, update, and toggle post active status.
    4. ⚙️ Swagger Integration: Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI.
    5. 🔄 Database Automation: Auto-creates MySQL database if not already present.
    6. 🌐 CORS Policy: Secure access through origin and referer validation.

🔧 Deployment:


The project is hosted on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu) using Apache2.


💼 What I Learned


I built and deployed this entire backend API project by myself — from writing raw PHP logic and authentication, to setting up the Apache server, configuring CORS, implementing Swagger documentation, and deploying to the cloud.
